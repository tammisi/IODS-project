# 1. Load the data sets (BPRS and RATS) into R 
BPRS <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/BPRS.txt",
                   header = T)
RATS <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoVehkalahti/MABS/master/Examples/data/rats.txt",
                   header = T)

# BPRS data:
# 40 male subjects randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and each subject was rated
# on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (week 0) and then 
# at weekly intervals for eight weeks. The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as 
# hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; each of these is rated from one 
# (not present) to seven (extremely severe). The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having
# schizophrenia.

# RATS data:
# data from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats (Crowder and Hand, 1990). 
# The three groups were put on different diets, and each animalâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded 
# repeatedly (approximately weekly, except in week seven when two recordings were taken) over a 9-week
# period. The question of most interest is whether the growth profiles of the three groups differ.


# 2. Convert the categorical variables of both data sets to factors
BPRS$treatment <- factor(BPRS$treatment)
BPRS$subject <- factor(BPRS$subject)

RATS$ID <- factor(RATS$ID)
RATS$Group <- factor(RATS$Group)

# 3. Convert the data sets to long form. Add a week variable to BPRS and a Time variable to RATS
BPRSL <-  pivot_longer(BPRS, cols = -c(treatment, subject),
                       names_to = "weeks", values_to = "bprs") %>%
  arrange(weeks) #order by weeks variable

RATSL <-  pivot_longer(RATS, cols = -c(ID, Group),
                       names_to = "WD", values_to = "Weight") %>%
  arrange(WD) #order by weeks variable

BPRSL <-  BPRSL %>% 
  mutate(week = as.integer(substr(weeks, 5,5)))

RATSL <- RATSL %>% 
  mutate(Time = as.integer(substr(WD, 3,4))) 

# 4. Now, take a serious look at the new data sets and compare them with their wide form versions: 
# Check the variable names, view the data contents and structures, and create some brief summaries 
# of the variables. Make sure that you understand the point of the long form data and the crucial 
# difference between the wide and the long forms before proceeding the to Analysis exercise.

# In the wide format every measure that varies in time occupies a set of columns, whereas in the long 
# format there will be multiple records for each individual. Some variables that do not vary in time 
# (such as group or ID)are identical in each record, whereas other variables vary across the records
# In BPRS data, the psychiatric rating scales for tne 40 participants are combined into one variable 
# and the corresponding week is added as a new column. Similarly in RATS data, the weights measured 
# at different time points for each individual rat are combined into one column and the corresponding 
# time point or day is added as a new column.
